      I would like to share my experience of working with Natalya. During my work at Cinimex, I worked with Natalya on the same project. It was comfortable to work, and I was pleased that Natalya helps the rest of the team members.
      The code is written thoughtfully and at the same time readable. I think that Natalya is an excellent developer and I would gladly agree to work together again.

    text: <>I like that Natalya tests her tasks on stands. Before her, developers have almost never done that, and now they took that as a rule. 
    It's good that she isn't afraid to ask questions.
    They're problems with estimation of tasks, but I think it'll go away with the dive in.
    Communication with Natalya is very comfortable.
