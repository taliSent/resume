      I would like to share my experience of working with Natalya. During my work at Cinimex, I worked with Natalya on the same project. It was comfortable to work, and I was pleased that Natalya helps the rest of the team members.
      <br />
      The code is written thoughtfully and at the same time readable. I think that Natalya is an excellent developer and I would gladly agree to work together again.

    text: <>I've been working with Natalya in Cinimex for about half a year. Natalya appeared to be a reliable developer. 
    She responded appropriately to the code-review, made suggestions to tasks solution.
    <br />
    She might want to speak louder on meet-ups :)       
    <br />
    I got a positive impression of working with Natalya : 3

    text: <>I like that Natalya tests her tasks on stands. Before her, developers have almost never done that, and now they took that as a rule. 
    It's good that she isn't afraid to ask questions.
    They're problems with estimation of tasks, but I think it'll go away with the dive in.
    Communication with Natalya is very comfortable.

    During my work with Natalya I've got the following impression of her:
      <ul>
        <li>
          She's got great communication soft skills (life and work communications are pleasant)
        </li>
        <li>She's a team player</li>
        <li>She quickly puzzled out the project and started to deal with serious tasks</li>
      </ul>
